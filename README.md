## Step by step Process
### Data Preparation:

- Using Power Query for cleaning and transforming data. For instance, it handles missing values, creates calculated columns, and filters datasets.
- Relationships between tables are properly established in the data model.

### Visual Creation:

- Each Botton must have the following visuals:
- Summary: Cards, Pie Chart, Bar Charts, and Line Chart for trends
- Customer: Cards, Table, Pie Chart, and Bar Charts for customer details.
- Product: Clustered Bar Chart, Line Chart and Scatter Plots of Profitability & Sales Trending.

### Interactivity & Navigation

- All pages include filters with slicers in respect to State, Ship Mode, Segment, SubCategory and Year.
- Apply Bookmark & Selection Pane to be used as page level navigation- like Summary, Customer and Product.
- Add a set of buttons, like the "Start" or navigation arrow buttons for seamless user navigation

### Dashboard Customization & Publishing:

- Use themes, logos and background in making an attractive dashboard design.
- Test all the interactions and filters with smooth functionality.
- Publish the dashboard to the Power BI Service.
